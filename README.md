# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains classic algorithms and data structures implemented in C++.

> 🚧 **This repository is under construction.**
> Some implementations and files may be incomplete or subject to change.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/algorithms`: Implementations of common algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversals, and more.
- `/data_structures`: Core data structure implementations including lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

## 💻 Language

All code is written in **C++**.
